## Analysis and Visualization of Netflix dataset
In this Project,I have taken a sample dataset from Kaggle.com and created a dashboard reporting the shows/movies aired by Netflix from the countries they originate alongside their rating and genre. 
From the raw data I received, I had to clean and organize the dataset.
